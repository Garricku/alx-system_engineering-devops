monitoring

<h2>Background Context</h2>
“You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure” is a famous saying in the Tech industry. In the age of the data-ism, monitoring how our Software systems are doing is an important thing. In this project, we will implement one of many tools to measure what is going on our servers.

<h3>Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:<h3>

<p>Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected<br>
Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<p>
Why is monitoring needed<br>
What are the 2 main area of monitoring<br>
What are access logs for a web server (such as Nginx)<br>
What are error logs for a web server (such as Nginx)<br>
