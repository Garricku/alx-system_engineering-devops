<h1>Postmortem</h1>
<p>Using one of the web stack debugging project issue or an outage you have personally face, write a postmortem. Most of you will never have faced an outage, so just get creative and invent your own :)</p>
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
<h3>Issue Summary (that is often what executives will read) must contain:</h3>
<li>duration of the outage with start and end times (including timezone)</li>
<li>what was the impact (what service was down/slow? What were user experiencing? How many % of the users were affected?)</li>
<li>what was the root cause</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<h3>Timeline (format bullet point, format: time - keep it short, 1 or 2 sentences) must contain:</h3>
<li>when was the issue detected</li>
<li>how was the issue detected (monitoring alert, an engineer noticed something, a customer complained…)</li>
<li>actions taken (what parts of the system were investigated, what were the assumption on the root cause of the issue)</li>
<li>misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken</li>
<li>which team/individuals was the incident escalated to</li>
<li>how the incident was resolved</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<h3>Root cause and resolution must contain:</h3>
<li>explain in detail what was causing the issue</li>
<li>explain in detail how the issue was fixed</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<h3>Corrective and preventative measures must contain:</h3>
<li>what are the things that can be improved/fixed (broadly speaking)</li>
<li>a list of tasks to address the issue (be very specific, like a TODO, example: patch Nginx server, add monitoring on server memory…)</li>
<li>Be brief and straight to the point, between 400 to 600 words</li>
</ul>
